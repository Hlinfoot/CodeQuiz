# CodeQuiz

The use of this application is to understand how to manipulate the DOM, html, and javascript by creating a quiz that does the following:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

In the code that was given, I have made comments to display my understanding of the code.
